# Amazona-Ecommerce-Amazon-Clone
A MERN solution cloning Amazon. Here I am working with several exciting tools: 
- NextJS basics like setting up project, navigating between pages and data fetching
- NextJS advanced topics like dynamic routing, image optimization,  SSG and SSR
- MaterialUI framework to build responsive website using custom theme, animation and carousel
- ReactJS including decomposing components, context API and hooks
- Next Connect package to build backend API
- MongoDB and Mongoose to save and retrieve data like products, orders and users
- PayPal developer api to make online payment
- Deployment on servers like Vercel and Netlify


Expect daily updates!
